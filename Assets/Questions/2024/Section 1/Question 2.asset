  question: John 3:16 says
  answers:
  - 'The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants
    things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel
    unto his servant John:'
  - Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not
    these things?
  - 'And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of
    man be lifted up:'
  - For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes
    in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
